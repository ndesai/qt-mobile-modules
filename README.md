## Qt Mobile Modules ##

A collection of platform integrations to allow Qt/QML interfaces to commonly used iOS functionality.  

Android support is planned but currently not started/implemented. If you are interested in developing for Android, please create a pull request and we can start building a universal library of Qt mobile components.
